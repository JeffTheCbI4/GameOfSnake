# GameOfSnake
This is my first attempt on making a game in general and, in particular, a Snake game.

# How to play
Click "Start" button, then "Play" button. Use the following keys on your keyboard to control your Snake:

W - move UP

A - move LEFT

S - move DOWN

D - move RIGHT

You gain points by eating fruits. You can increase Point Modifier by eating a 2X Bonus. Multiple eaten bonuses stack up, but only temporaly.
When bump into a wall or eat yourself, the game is over. You can start over by pressing "Play" button again.
